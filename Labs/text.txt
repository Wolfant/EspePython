Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.

The naming convention for functions may be used instead in 
cases where the interface is documented and used primarily as a callable.

Note that there is a separate convention for builtin names: 
most builtin names are single words 
(or two words run together), with the CapWords 
convention used only for exception names and builtin constants.
